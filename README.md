v1: In this version, you need to write a wrapper around https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. In this version, you need only to implement:

** GET: /allPosts -> Returns all posts for all users.

** GET: /allPosts/<username> -> Returns all posts for a specific user, by using their username.

** GET: /posts/<postid> -> returns a specific post by its ID number

** GET: /profile/<username> -> Returns a specific user's name.
